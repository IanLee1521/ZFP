zfp 0.2.1, December 12, 2014

  - Added Win64 support via Microsoft Visual Studio compiler.

  - Fixed broken support for IBM's xlc compiler.

  - Made several minor changes to suppress compiler warnings.

  - Documented expected output for the diffusion example.

zfp 0.2.0, December 2, 2014

  - The compression interface from zfpcompress was relocated to a
    separate library, called libzfp, and modified to be callable from C.
    This API now uses a parameter object (zfp_params) to specify array
    type and dimensions as well as compression parameters.

  - Several utility functions were added to simplify libzfp usage:

    o Functions for setting the rate, precision, and accuracy.
      Corresponding functions were also added to the Codec class.

    o A function for estimating the buffer size needed for compression.

  - The Array class functionality was expanded:

    o Support for accessing the compressed bit stream stored with an
      array, e.g. for offline compressed storage and for initializing
      an already compressed array.

    o Functions for dynamically specifying the cache size.

    o The default cache is now direct-mapped instead of two-way
      associative.

  - Minor bug fixes:

    o Corrected the value of the lowest possible bit plane to account for
      both the smallest exponent and the number of bits in the significand.

    o Corrected inconsistent use of rate and precision.  The rate refers
      to the number of compressed bits per floating-point value, while
      the precision refers to the number of uncompressed bits.  The Array
      API was changed accordingly.
